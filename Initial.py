#My approch to the problem
'''
Each day has 28 timeslots, each represents half an hour. each timeslot will be an object (class) and it will have a methode isOccupied which tells if that time slot has already been taken by returning a boolean.
-The class will also have a method which fills that time table with a course, and will change the obj boolean once the slot is full.
-The toString methode will print the time slot and the occuping course; maybe also section, and if the slot is empty it would print the time of the slot and empty
Eg: "9:00, ITI110 Z00" or "8:30, Empty".
-Each day is a list of timeslots.
-I used the 24 hour format rather than AM and PM, at last for the sake of coding.
